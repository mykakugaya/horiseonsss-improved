Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. Website

This project involved taking an existing webpage and improving the web accessibility of the site. I altered the layout of content and created more user-friendly features to make this website easier to visit and use.

Specifically, I worked on the following:
- Modified website title to be specific
- Shortened the height of the main image to show more of the website at first glance
- Fixed the links in the menu headings
- Added "alt" attributes to describe each image (used "title" for main cover image)
- Added a "Benefits" heading for clearer section communication, also added to header menu
- Changed colors of text/background and added lines so headings catch more attention
- Lessened content padding + increased font sizes so that words appear larger and easier to read
- Made the boxes+text automatically shrink/extend when browser window size is narrowed/extended
- Created a "Back to Top" button for easier navigation
- Added pseudoclasses for buttons and links
- Added notes throughout HTML file for convenience of future developers/readers
