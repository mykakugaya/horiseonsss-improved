Horiseon website

In order to make this website more accessible, I changed the following:
- Changed website title to be specific
- Shortened the height of the main image to show more of the website at first glance
- Fixed the links in the menu headings
- Created a "Back to Top" button for easier navigation
- Added a "Benefits" heading for clearer communication, also added to header menu
- Changed colors of text/background and added lines so headings catch more attention
- Added "alt" attributes to describe each image
- Lessened content padding + increased font sizes so that words appear larger and easier to read
- Made the background boxes automatically shrink/extend to include text when browser window size is narrowed/extended by adjusting heights and positioning
- Added notes throughout HTML file for convenience of future developers
